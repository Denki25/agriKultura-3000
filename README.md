🌱 Binhi Heritage Museum

A decentralized virtual museum that preserves endangered Filipino crops and ancestral farming traditions using NFTs, interactive storytelling, and blockchain technology — built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

📌 Overview

Binhi Heritage Museum (from the Filipino word "binhi," meaning "seed") is a Web3-powered platform where users can:
Explore a virtual museum of native and endangered crops.
Learn cultural histories and indigenous farming practices.
Collect, adopt, or sponsor NFT-based seed exhibits.
Contribute to real-world conservation efforts through traceable donations.
Play interactive mini-games and quests to unlock knowledge about Filipino agriculture.

🛡️ The goal is to digitally immortalize the wisdom of traditional farming before it disappears, while promoting blockchain-backed participation and preservation.
